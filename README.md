# Project-Game
Written in Python 3.7.
My first attempt at a major project. I ran into many struggles and it was not easy, but I had a lot of fun writting it. 
As for running the program, choose the most recent version, currently Version 0.3.1, and all you will have to do 
is download and run the program for it to start working.
There is all documentation and rules already in the program so any questions should be able to be answered there.
The only other thing I'd recommend is that you use either power-ups mode or preferably Mayhem mode, as the game can be a bit
bland otherwise.
Other than that, thank you for taking the time to check out my first attempt at a major project.
